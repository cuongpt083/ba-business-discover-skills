## 🧠 Core Principle (Very Important)

You are not learning a domain to become a specialist.
You are learning it to find problems and improve outcomes.

This procedure focuses on decision-useful knowledge, not trivia.

### 🧩 Master Framework (Use This Every Time)
1. Domain Decomposition Framework

Break any domain into these 6 lenses:

* Business Goals & Value

* Stakeholders & Users

* Core Workflows

* Information & Data

Systems & Tools

Pain Points & Constraints

Everything you research must map to one of these.

2. Question-Driven Learning (Critical Skill)

You do NOT “study”.
You hunt answers to high-value questions.

Example:

❌ “What is X industry?”

✅ “How does X industry make money, and where does it lose money?”

🧠 Professional BA Mental Models (Memorize These)
1. Systems Thinking

A problem is rarely local. Fixing one area breaks another.

2. Incentive Awareness

People optimize for what they are measured on.

3. Constraint-First Thinking

The best solution inside constraints beats the perfect one outside.

4. Language Mastery

If you use the domain’s language, stakeholders trust you faster.

📌 Tools You Should Use

Miro / FigJam → workflows & maps

Notion / Confluence → domain wiki

Excel → pain point tracking

PowerPoint → synthesis

🚀 How You Know You’re “Good Enough”

You can:

Explain the domain to a new joiner in 10 minutes

Ask better questions than juniors

Predict stakeholder objections

Suggest improvements without sounding naive
